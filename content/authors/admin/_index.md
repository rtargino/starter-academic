I am an Assistant Professor (Lecturer) in Statistics at the School of Applied Mathematics (EMAp), at the Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV).

From 2012 to 2016, I was a PhD candidate at the Department of Statistical Science, at the University College London (UCL). In 2014 I was also a recepient of the Australia Award Endeavour Research Fellowship.

After a completing a BSc in Applied Mathematics and a MSc in Statistics (both from Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) I spent 2.5 years working at the financial industry in Brazil, first as a Credit Risk Modelling Analyst at Ita√∫-Unibanco Bank and then as a Market Risk Analyst at Credit-Suisse Hedging-Griffo. During the Masters I also collaborated on a IMPA / Petrobras research project, mainly focused on Real Options problems.
