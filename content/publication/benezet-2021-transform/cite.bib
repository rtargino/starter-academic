 abstract = {In financial risk management, modelling dependency within a random vector $X̧$ is crucial, a standard approach is the use of a copula model. Say the copula model can be sampled through realizations of $\$̧ having copula function $C$: had the marginals of $\c ̧been known, sampling $\cX,̧ the $i$-th component of $\cX$w̧ould directly follow by composing $\cYi$i̧th its cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) and the inverse c.d.f. of $\cXi$.ņ this work, the marginals of $\cY$ arņot explicit, as in a factor copula model. We design an algorithm which samples $\cX$ thrģh an empirical approximation of the c.d.f. of the $\cY$-marga̧ls. To be able to handle complex distributions for $\cY$ or ra-̧event computations, we allow Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers. We establish convergence results whose rates depend on the tails of $\cX$, $\cY$ņd they̧apunov function of the MCMC sampler. We present numerical experiments confirming the convergence rates and also revisit a real data analysis from financial risk management.},
