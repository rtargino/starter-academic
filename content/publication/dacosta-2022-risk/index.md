abstract: Risk budgeting is a portfolio strategy where each asset contributes a prespecified
  amount to the aggregate risk of the portfolio. In this work, we propose a numerical
  framework that uses only simulations of returns for estimating risk budgeting portfolios.
  Specifically, we provide a Sample Average Approximation (SAA) algorithm with cutting
  planes, and a Stochastic Gradient Decent (SGD) algorithm, tailored to the risk budgeting
  portfolio for the Expected Shortfall. We illustrate different risk budgeting portfolios,
  constructed using a especially designed Julia package, on real financial data and
  compare it to classical portfolio strategies.
