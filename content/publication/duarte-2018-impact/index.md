abstract: We provide empirical evidence that changes in the level of the freedom of
  the press have a substantial impact on important risk measures. Using data from
  the Freedom of the Press annual report to capture how freely the news media can
  operate, we investigate how changes in the freedom of the press impact financial
  markets' volatility and the economic policy uncertainty index.Using data from eight
  of the OECD countries and the BRIC countries, we present empirical evidence that
  the effect of the freedom of the press shocks on the economic policy uncertainty
  index and on the financial markets' volatility is quite distinct, providing further
  support that both measures of risk capture different dimensions of uncertainty.
  In addition, we show that the freedom of the press deteriorates during economic
  recessions relative to economic expansions.
