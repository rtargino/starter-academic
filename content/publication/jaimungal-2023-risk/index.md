abstract: We define and develop an approach for risk budgeting allocation -- a risk
  diversification portfolio strategy -- where risk is measured using a dynamic time-consistent
  risk measure. For this, we introduce a notion of dynamic risk contributions that
  generalise the classical Euler contributions and which allow us to obtain dynamic
  risk contributions in a recursive manner. We prove that, for the class of dynamic
  coherent distortion risk measures, the risk allocation problem may be recast as
  a sequence of strictly convex optimisation problems. Moreover, we show that any
  self-financing dynamic risk budgeting strategy with initial wealth of 1 is a scaled
  version of the unique solution of the sequence of convex optimisation problems.
  Furthermore, we develop an actor-critic approach, leveraging the elicitability of
  dynamic risk measures, to solve for risk budgeting strategy using deep learning.
