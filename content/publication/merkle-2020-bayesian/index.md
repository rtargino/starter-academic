abstract: We propose a two stage procedure for the estimation of the parameters of
  a fairly general, continuous-time stochastic volatility model. An important ingredient
  of the proposed method is the Cuchiero–Teichmann volatility estimator, which is
  based on Fourier transforms and provides a continuous-time estimate of the latent
  process. This estimate is then used to construct an approximate likelihood for the
  parameters of interest, whose restrictions are taken into account through prior
  distributions. The procedure is shown to be highly successful for constructing the
  posterior distribution of the parameters of a Heston model, while limited success
  is achieved when applied to the highly parametrized exponential-Ornstein–Uhlenbeck.
