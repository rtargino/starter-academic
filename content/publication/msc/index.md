abstract: Starting from the interest of modeling financial products through
  the usage of non-Markovian processes a possibility is the utilization of the
  so called fractional Brownian motion. However, since this process is not a
  semimartingale, the classic mathematical modeling of continuous time finance
  ensures that there exists some possibility of capital gain without risk. This
  work presents two theorems about the inexistence of arbitrage possibilities in
  models driven by the fractional Brownian motion. The adicional hypothesis
  of the theorems (in relation to the classical modeling) do not turn them more
  unreal, on the contrary, because they are, in one of the cases, the requirement
  of a minimum waiting time between two consecutive transactions and, in the
  other case, the inclusion of transaction costs proportional to the assetâ€™s value.
  It also presents some estimators for the long memory parameter that can be
  used to corroborate the hypothesis on the existence of this phenomenon in
  financial assets pricing.
