abstract: We propose a stochastic model for claims reserving that captures dependence
  along development years within a single triangle. This dependence is of autoregressive
  form of order  and is achieved through the use of latent variables. We carry out
  bayesian inference on model parameters and borrow strength across several triangles,
  coming from different lines of businesses or companies, through the use of hierarchical
  priors.
