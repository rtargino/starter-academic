abstract: The main objective of this work is to develop a detailed step-by-step guide
  to the development and application of a new class of efficient Monte Carlo methods
  to solve practically important problems faced by insurers under the new solvency
  regulations. In particular, a novel Monte Carlo method to calculate capital allocations
  for a general insurance company is developed, with a focus on coherent capital allocation
  that is compliant with the Swiss Solvency Test. The data used is based on the balance
  sheet of a representative stylized company. For each line of business in that company,
  allocations are calculated for the one-year risk with dependencies based on correlations
  given by the Swiss Solvency Test. Two different approaches for dealing with parameter
  uncertainty are discussed and simulation algorithms based on (pseudo-marginal) Sequential
  Monte Carlo algorithms are described and their efficiency is analysed.
