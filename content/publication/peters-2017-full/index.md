abstract: 'We revisit the gamma–gamma Bayesian chain-ladder (BCL) model for claims
  reserving in non-life insurance. This claims reserving model is usually used in
  an empirical Bayesian way using plug-in estimates for the variance parameters. The
  advantage of this empirical Bayesian framework is that allows us for closed form
  solutions. The main purpose of this paper is to develop the full Bayesian case also
  considering prior distributions for the variance parameters and to study the resulting
  sensitivities. '
