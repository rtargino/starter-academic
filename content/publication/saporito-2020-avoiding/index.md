abstract: This paper is concerned with the process of risk allocation for a generic
  multivariate model when the risk measure is chosen as the Value-at-Risk (VaR). Making
  use of Malliavin calculus, we recast the traditional Euler contributions from an
  expectation conditional to an event of zero probability to a ratio of conditional
  expectations, where both the numerator and the denominator's conditioning events
  have positive probability. For several different models we show empirically that
  the estimator using this novel representation has no perceivable bias and variance
  smaller than a standard estimator used in practice.
