abstract: In this paper we demonstrate how to develop analytic closed form solutions
  to optimal multiple stopping time problems arising in the setting in which the value
  function acts on a compound process that is modified by the actions taken at the
  stopping times. This class of problem is particularly relevant in insurance and
  risk management settings and we demonstrate this on an important application domain
  based on insurance strategies in Operational Risk management for financial institutions.
  In this area of risk management the most prevalent class of loss process models
  is the Loss Distribution Approach (LDA) framework which involves modelling annual
  losses via a compound process. Given an LDA model framework, we consider Operational
  Risk insurance products that mitigate the risk for such loss processes and may reduce
  capital requirements. In particular, we consider insurance products that grant the
  policy holder the right to insure k of its annual Operational losses in a horizon
  of T years. We consider two insurance product structures and two general model settings,
  the first are families of relevant LDA loss models that we can obtain closed form
  optimal stopping rules for under each generic insurance mitigation structure and
  then secondly classes of LDA models for which we can develop closed form approximations
  of the optimal stopping rules. In particular, for losses following a compound Poisson
  process with jump size given by an Inverse-Gaussian distribution and two generic
  types of insurance mitigation, we are able to derive analytic expressions for the
  loss process modified by the insurance application, as well as closed form solutions
  for the optimal multiple stopping rules in discrete time (annually). When the combination
  of insurance mitigation and jump size distribution does not lead to tractable stopping
  rules we develop a principled class of closed form approximations to the optimal
  decision rule. These approximations are developed based on a class of orthogonal
  Askey polynomial series basis expansion representations of the annual loss compound
  process distribution and functions of this annual loss.
