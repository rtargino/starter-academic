abstract: The Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index from Baker et al. [QJE, 2016] is computed as a proportion of news articles that  contain EPU-related words over the total number of articles in the period. Although fully automatic, this approach requires the group of EPU-related words to be chosen in advance, which leaves the index subject to changes in the vocabulary used to describe economic policy uncertainty. In this work we take, instead, a semi-automatic route to text classification. First a sample of the articles is manually read and classified as belonging to the topic (e.g. EPU) or not; then, supervised learning algorithms are used to classify the unread articles and to compute the index. In this paper we present results for both a static and a dynamically sparse regression model.
