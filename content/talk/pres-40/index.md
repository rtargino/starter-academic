abstract: In this talk I will present the recent developments made by our group at
  FGV regarding the economic uncertainty index. In the first part, accessible to the
  general public, I will describe the economic uncertainty index and its Brazilian
  version, developed and calculated by FGV. In the second part, we use Bayesian inference
  methods for missing data in asynchronous freedom of the press data and show that
  the economic uncertainty index is, in a way, orthogonal to the volatility of the
  stock indexes of the local markets. In the last part of the talk I will present
  our advances in the direction of improving this and other word-based indexes, where
  we use Bayesian methods of particle filters to understand the importance of each
  word in the construction of an index.
