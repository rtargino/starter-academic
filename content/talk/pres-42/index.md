abstract: Large pension plans face the difficulty of investing premiums in a financially
  prudent but economically efficient way. An investment concept used in industry,
  e.g., by pension funds, is *risk budgeting portfolios* (RBP). RBP are diversified
  portfolios where the diversification is on the level of the risk contribution of
  each asset to the risk of the total portfolio loss.  In this work, we assess the
  risk of the portfolio via a coherent risk measure, such as the Expected Shortfall.
  The risk contribution of an asset, is then the added risk of marginally increasing
  the portfolio's position in that asset. Hence, risk budgeting portfolios are diversified
  in terms of the risk stemming from each asset and therefore ideal for pension plans
  which face stringent investment requirements. Advances in the academic literature
  and practical implementations of RBP strategies, however, make the strong assumption
  that assets are multivariate Gaussian. We propose an efficient stochastic optimization
  framework that calculates RBP for assets with arbitrary joint distribution. Moreover,
  the RBP is constructed using only sampled scenarios, making it applicable in a variety
  of settings such as data-driven statistical models, arbitrary dependency structures,
  and internal loss models.
