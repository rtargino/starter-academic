abstract: This talk is concerned with the process of risk allocation for a generic
  multivariate model when the risk measure is chosen as the Value-at-Risk (VaR). We
  recast the traditional Euler contributions from an expectation conditional to an
  event of zero probability to a ratio of conditional expectations, where both the
  numerator and the denominator's conditioning events have positive probability. For
  several different models we show empirically that the estimator using this novel
  representation has no perceivable bias and variance smaller than a standard estimator
  used in practice.
